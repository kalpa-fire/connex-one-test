# CONNEX ONE TECHNICAL TEST

This is a React/Express app created as a response to the Connex One technical test. Due to time constraints, priority has been given to functionality over style. Both backend and frontend apps have some test coverage -- additional tests could be added as required.

## Running the project

Running the `npm start` command on the root directory will install all dependencies and concurrently run the start scripts for frontend and backend. Once the script finishes running, the website will be accessible on `localhost:3000`.

## Running the tests
The `npm run test` script on the root project will run tests for both backend and frontend. Alternatively, tests can be run for each individual app with `npm run test:frontend` or `npm run test:backend`

## A note on environment variables

A `.env` file with the necessary environment variables has been uploaded onto the repository for the sake of convenience. In a production setting the file would be gitignored (I promise!)
